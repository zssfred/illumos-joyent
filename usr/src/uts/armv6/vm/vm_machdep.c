 * Let's talk about page coloring on ARMv6. ARMv6 uses VIPT caches. Assuming a
 * 4k page, the lower two bits are subject to page coloring. Therefore we need 4
 * page colors. Thinking ahead, some parts of ARMv7 have PIPT caches, but still
 * have VIPT instruction caches. Therefore, we'll initiailize the hw_page_array
 * with the default amount of page coloring -- 4, but allow an individual
 * platform to overwrite that as we initialize the MMU.
 *
 * In addition, we always set vac_colors to one to indicate that we need virtual
 * address caching.
 *
 * XXX This isn't all wired up at this time, make it so.
