 * DNS Host-name related functions.
 *
 * Every backend is stored in DNS. To find out memebership, we query DNS and use
 * that to update our world. We update our DNS records on both a timer
 * granularity and immediately after creation. We'll also XXX go through and do
 * this after all of our valid entries have disappeared.
 *
 * Unfortuantely, doing host name resolution in a way that allows us to leverage
 * the system resolvers and the system's caching, require us to use blocking
 * calls in libc. If we can't reach a given server, that will tie up a thread
 * for quite some time. To work around that fact, we're going to create a fixed
 * number of threads and we'll use them to service this kind of work. While not
 * great, we don't have many better options.
