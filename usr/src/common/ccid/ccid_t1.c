/*
 * Track the state of the T=1 protocol. In general, there is a notion of us
 * sending a series of one or more blocks that may be chained. Each block will
 * receive an acknowledgement. When we send the last block that we care about,
 * then we will receive a response which will consist of one or more blocks.
 *
 * These data blocks are called I-blocks. The acknowledgement blocks are called
 * R-blocks. There are also a special third type of block called S-blocks. The
 * S-Blocks are not used for data, but for protocol-level requests.
 *
 * The OS will always initiate requests. The ICC cannot initiate requests.
 *
 * There are a series of conditions that may cause the transmission to fail. In
 * the T=1 specification, these transition us to a series of escalating retry
 * steps:
 *
 *   o Retransmission
 *   o Use of S(RESYNCH) request
 *   o Warm reset
 *
 * The rest of this file provides routines to construct headers, epilogues, and
 * more.

 *

 *		transmitted. This may be issued by the reader or the ICC. The
 *		issuer is describing what size it is that they need to change.
 *		When the ICC is first detected, we will issue an IFS request to
 *		increase the reader's IFS. At any time, the ICC is allowed to
 *		issue an IFS request. However, the initial value is determined
 *		based on the ATR.
 *
 *  o ABORT -	This is used to cancel a chain or series of commands. At this
 *		time, the framework does not issue aborts. If we receive one
 *		from the card, then we will issue a warm reset and fail the
 *		command.
 *
 *  o WTX -	This is used by the card to indicate that it is still
 *		processing; however it requires additional time. When this
 *		is received, we must acknowledge it. However, we must also
 *		increase the default waiting time here and in the command.
