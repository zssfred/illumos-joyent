# The version string is composed according to IPS version string rules:
#	dotted verstion strings are consisting of numbers and dots,
#	different strings are separated by comma or dash,
#	at the end of the dotted version can be timestamp, separated by
#	the colon.
#
# The dotted version part are compared by numbers, timestamps are
# compared lexicographically, as strings.
#
# Here we define two version strings, for loader and boot program.
# The BOOT_VERSION is used by installboot program to decide if the
# boot program update is needed, and should be updated according to
# boot loader code updates.

LOADER_VERSION = 1.1

# Use date like formatting here, YYYY.MM.DD.XX, without leading zeroes.
# The version is processed from left to right, the version number can only
# be increased.
BOOT_VERSION = $(LOADER_VERSION)-2019.12.05.1
