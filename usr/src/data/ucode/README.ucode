Microcode Management

Historically microcode files were delivered by Intel as a single
microcode file that we would break apart and install with ucodeadm. Each
individual file represented a single platform's microcode. However,
recently Intel has changed that policy and is no longer distributing
microcode in that fashion. Further, we also relied on bootadm to go
through and turn this microcode into individual files as part of setting
up the boot environment.

Intead of using this method, we will update the microcode and manage
them in here as individual files. When updating files, please indicate
the release that the microcode was obtained from here.

The upstream microcode for Intel can currently be found at:

https://github.com/intel/Intel-Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-Files

The script "update.intel" in this directory can be used to help automate
the update by providing a tarball of the above microcode, and takes care
of updating the manifest as necessary. Be careful about new files.

AMD: Updated in March 2012 as part of illumos#2546. Exact revision
unknown.

Intel: Linux 20191115 release
